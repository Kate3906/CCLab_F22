    <h2>What is Psychology</h2>
    <p>Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists are actively involved in studying and
        understanding mental processes, brain functions, and behavior. The field of psychology is considered a "Hub
        Science" with strong connections to the medical sciences, social sciences, and education (Boyack, Klavans, &
        Borner, 2005).</p>
